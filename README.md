# Codes.Ohio.Gov-Indenter.user.js

Ohio's laws at https://codes.ohio.gov/ are hard to read because they lack indenting.  Their divisions like (A) and (B) are presented at the same indentation as subdivisions like (1) and (2).

The **Codes.Ohio.Gov-Indenter.user.js** "[userscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript)" in this repository indents and thereby improves the readability of Ohio's online Revised Code (laws) and Adminstrative Code at http://codes.ohio.gov/.  The userscript indents divisions, subdivisions, sub-subdivisions, etc.

  **WARNING!**  *Userscripts can be very useful, but userscript technology is inherently dangerous because the browser extension they run within (see below) has access to **every** page you use.  Do NOT install such an extension and do NOT use any userscript unless you are very comfortable with what they are doing!*

## What is a userscript?

A [userscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) can modify webpages while you are viewing it to provide [augmented browsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_browsing).  Userscripts, including this one, are typically loaded by and run within a userscript manager browser extension.

## INSTALLATION:

1. First, go install a userscript manager browser extension like [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) or [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/).
1. Then, go to the following URL to install the script:

## NEED SUPPORT?

Go create an [issue](https://github.com/jon-freed/Codes.Ohio.Gov-Indenter.user.js/issues).  Please bear in mind that this is free software that has been donated to the public domain through [the Unlicense](http://unlicense.org/) and support may be quite slow in coming.
