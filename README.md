# Codes.Ohio.Gov-Indenter.user.js
The **Codes.Ohio.Gov-Indenter.user.js** file is a "userscript"  that can be used by web browser extensions like [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) or [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) that facilitate [augmented browsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_browsing).

The script is for http://codes.ohio.gov/, which is Ohio's online copy of its Revised Code (laws) and Administrative Code.  The script indents the ORC and OAC's divisions and subdivisions, etc., which greatly improves their readability.

##INSTALLATION:
If you already have a browser extension like [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) or [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/), then just go to the following URL to install the script:
