# Codes.Ohio.Gov-Indenter

Ohio's laws at https://codes.ohio.gov/ are hard to read because they lack indenting.  Their divisions like (A) and (B) are presented at the same indentation as subdivisions like (1) and (2).

This repository contains the code for the **Codes.Ohio.Gov-Indenter** [browser extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_extension) that indents and thereby improves the readability of Ohio's online Revised Code (laws) and Adminstrative Code at http://codes.ohio.gov/.  The browser extension indents divisions, subdivisions, sub-subdivisions, etc.

## What is a browser extension?

A [browser extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_extension) can modify a webpage while you are viewing it to improve or otherwise change how it looks or what it does.

The only thing this Codes.Ohio.gov Indenter extension does is indent the Revised Code and Administrative Code. It does not, for example, add anything beyond indentation, remove anything, or transmit any data to anywhere.
